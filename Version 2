Per-user reading notification list:

mangadex.org/title/50300
Ask what chapter > user input chapter number > looks for (user chapter # input +1 or something)
If found, increment the number (X+2 now) + ping user who is subscribed.

Also have a short explanation posted when the command is run that the link has to be from the light novel / manga home page where the list of chapters is.

I would like the User list to have an emote next to new updates.

Title | current chapter : total chapters

Commands:
Roberta add "T: (Title)" "N: (number)" "L: (Link)" to my reading list. T:, N:, and L: are the delimiters.
Roberta update "Title" to "Chapter Y" on my reading list.

==RECALLING DELETED OR EDITED TEXT==

Roberta snipe (number)
roberta passively copies all messages to a file and deletes entries after 30 seconds. This gives roberta the ability to recall up to 10 messages (Roberta snipe 10)

Roberta editsnipe *same thing but with message edits* 

==Warn reason mandatory==

@Roberta warn @user
Roberta: "Why?" (if no reason given)

==24/7 uptime and redundancy==

real time application with fail safes
Server startup > auto run roberta 1
Instance 1 of roberta fully running then starts 2
Instance 2 of roberta starts and sees that 1 is running somehow and waits.

if 1 crashes or reboots, 2 takes over immediately.

Some way to schedule restart of the instances one at a time

2 reboots 1 after X uptime. After 1 is fully up, 1 reboots 2 then goes back to waiting.


Option to auto delete warnings on a per server basis


set a "hi" response timer per person or make it random whether she responds to hi 5 mins
